## Key Information

- **Lines**: Represent total strikeouts for the pitcher in the entire game
- **Consensus Odds**: Averaged from multiple sportsbooks using implied probabilities
- **Sportsbooks Included**: FanDuel, DraftKings, BetMGM, BetRivers, Bovada, BetOnline.ag, and more
- **Update Frequency**: The Odds API updates odds frequently throughout the day

## API Details

This project uses [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) which provides:
- Real-time betting odds from 40+ sportsbooks
- Player props for MLB (and other sports)
- Both American and decimal odds formats
- Historical odds data

### API Limits
- Free tier: 500 requests per month
- Paid tiers available for higher usage

## Notes

- Props are typically posted closer to game time
- Not all games may have strikeout props available
- Lines can vary throughout the day as odds move
- The consensus calculation converts odds to implied probabilities, averages them, then converts back

## Troubleshooting

If you see "No strikeout props found":
1. Check if there are MLB games scheduled today
2. Props might not be posted yet (usually available 1-3 hours before games)
3. Some games might not have pitcher props available
4. Verify your API key is working

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add email notifications for favorable lines
- Track line movement over time
- Add more advanced statistical analysis
- Include pitcher stats and matchup data
- Export to CSV/Excel format
